This repo contains the same unbound.conf file that I use along with dot forwarding and public dns forwarding configs. 
Some bash alias scripts for easier shortcuts for commonly accessed items. 
In the forwarding configuration files the "." is the dns root zone of your server. If you want everything to be forwarded leave it as is. If you want specific domains replace the "." with the domain name you want forwarded for lookups.
